Feature: Prevent receiving transactions from undesired addresses
  As Alex
  I don't want to receive assets from Bobby
  So that I have control of which accounts can send me transactions
#  TODO: this and other restriction features do not have scenarios considering the direction of allow/block.
#   Scenario:
#  ALLOW_INCOMING_ADDRESS - done, ALLOW_OUTGOING_ADDRESS - not done!
