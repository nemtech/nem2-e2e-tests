Feature: Link a namespace to an asset
  As Alice,
  I want to link a namespace to an asset,
  So that it is memorable and easily recognizable

  @bvt
  Scenario: An account is able to send an asset using a namespace alias
    Given Alice registered the namespace "token"
    And Alice registered the asset "X"
    When Alice links the namespace "token" to the asset "X"
    Then Alice can send "token" instead of asset "X" to Bob

  @bvt
  Scenario: An account tries to send an asset using namespace alias to an asset after unlinking it
    Given Alice registered the namespace "asset"
    And Alice registered the asset "T"
    And Alice links the namespace "asset" to the asset "T"
    When Alice unlinks the namespace "asset" from the asset "T"
    And Alice tries to send "token" instead of asset "X" to Bob
    Then she should receive the error "FAILURE_CORE_INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE"

  @bvt
  Scenario: An account unlink an asset from a namespace after the asset expired
    Given Alice registered the namespace "assetexpire"
    And Alice has registered expiring asset "T" for 6 blocks
    And Alice links the namespace "assetexpire" to the asset "T"
    And the asset is now expired
    When Alice unlinks the namespace "assetexpire" from the asset "T"
    And Alice tries to send "assetexpire" instead of asset "T" to Bob
    Then she should receive the error "FAILURE_CORE_INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE"

  @bvt
  Scenario: An account is able to send an asset using a subnamespace alias
    Given Alice registered the namespace "alice"
    And Alice registered the subnamespace "alice.token"
    And Alice registered the asset "X"
    When Alice links the namespace "alice.token" to the asset "X"
    Then Alice can send "alice.token" instead of asset "X" to Bob

  @bvt
  Scenario: An account tries to send an asset using namespace alias to an asset after unlinking it
    Given Alice registered the namespace "alice"
    And Alice registered the subnamespace "alice.asset"
    And Alice registered the asset "T"
    And Alice links the namespace "alice.asset" to the asset "T"
    When Alice unlinks the namespace "alice.asset" from the asset "T"
    And Alice tries to send "alice.asset" instead of asset "T" to Bob
    Then she should receive the error "FAILURE_CORE_INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE"

  @bvt
  Scenario: An account tries to send an asset using invalid namespace alias
    Given Alice registered the namespace "unknownasset"
    When Alice tries to send "unknownasset" instead of asset "T" to Bob

  Scenario: An account swap an asset from a namespace alias
    Given Alice registered the namespace "token"
    And  Alice has registered expiring asset "T" for 6 blocks with supply 200 units
    And Alice links the namespace "token" to the asset "T"
    And Alice can send "token" instead of asset "T" to Bob
    And Alice unlinks the namespace "token" from the asset "T"
    And Alice has registered expiring asset "U" for 6 blocks with supply 200 units
    When Alice links the namespace "token" to the asset "U"
    And Alice can send "token" instead of asset "U" to Bob
    And Alice unlinks the namespace "token" from the asset "U"
    And Alice has registered expiring asset "Y" for 6 blocks with supply 200 units
    Then Alice links the namespace "token" to the asset "Y"
    And Alice can send "token" instead of asset "Y" to Bob

  Scenario: An account tries to link a namespace already in use (asset) to an asset
    Given Alice registered the namespace "token"
    And Alice registered the asset "X"
    And Alice links the namespace "token" to the asset "X"
    And Alice registered the asset "Z"
    When Alice tries to link the namespace "token" to the asset "Z"
    Then she should receive the error "FAILURE_NAMESPACE_ALIAS_ALREADY_EXISTS"

  Scenario: An account tries to link a namespace already in use (account) to an asset
    Given Alice registered the namespace "alice"

    Then she should receive the error "FAILURE_NAMESPACE_ALIAS_ALREADY_EXISTS"

  Scenario: An account tries to link an unknown namespace to an asset
    When Alice tries to link the namespace "unknown" to the asset "X"
    Then she should receive the error "FAILURE_NAMESPACE_UNKNOWN"

  Scenario: An account tries to unlink an unknown namespace to an asset
    Given Alice registered the asset "X"
    When Alice tries to unlink the namespace "unknown" from the asset "X"
    Then she should receive the error "FAILURE_NAMESPACE_UNKNOWN"

  Scenario: An account tries to link a namespace to an unknown asset
    Given Alice registered the namespace "token"
    When Alice tries to link the namespace "token" to the asset "unknown"
    Then she should receive the error "FAILURE_MOSAIC_EXPIRED"

  Scenario: An account tries to unlink a namespace from an unknown asset
    Given Alice registered the namespace "token"
    When Alice tries to unlink the namespace "token" from the asset "unknown"

    Given Alice registered the namespace "token"
    And Alice registered the asset "Y"
