  @bvt
  Scenario: Alice gets notify when a next block is created on the chain.
    Given Alice is register to receive notification from the blockchain
    When Alice waits for a next block
    Then Alice should receive a block notification

  @bvt
  Scenario: Alice gets notification when transaction in unconfirmed state
    Given Alice register to receive unconfirmed transaction notification
    When Alice announce valid transaction
    Then Alice should receive a transaction notification

  @bvt
  Scenario: Alice gets notification when transaction is removed from unconfirmed state

#    And Alice register to receive confirmed transaction notification
    And Sue register alias "sue" to receive confirmed transaction notification
    When Alice can send asset "X" to the namespace "sue" instead of the address of Sue
    Then Sue should receive a transaction notification
#    And Alice should receive a transaction notification

  @bvt
  Scenario: Alice gets notification when invalid transaction failed
    Given Alice register to receive error transaction notification
    And Alice defined the following bonded escrow contract:
      | type          | sender | recipient | data               |
      | send-an-asset | Alice  | Bob       | 1 network currency |
      | send-an-asset | Bob    | Sue       | 2 network currency |
